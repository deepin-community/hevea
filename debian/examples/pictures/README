This example demonstrates how to generate pictures in the PNG format, which
is the standard format for the Debian version of HeVeA (in contrast to the
original HeVeA distribution which uses gif as its default image format).

It also demonstrates how to obtain pictures in the GIF format.

To run this example you need the package texlive-latex-extra to be
installed (see the file /usr/share/doc/hevea/README.debian).
