.SH NAME
esponja \- Optimize HTML code.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B esponja
.RI "[options] files"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the
.BR esponja
command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux
distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
.B Esponja
tries to optimize HTML markup. It is not tolerant against non-valid
HTML files. If no \fIfile\fR is given then it reads from standard
input and writes to standard output. If at least on \fIfile\fR is
given then it operates by \fBmodifying\fR these files.

.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options are included below.
.TP
.B \-u
Output html files at intermediate stages of the optimization.
.TP
.B \-v
Switch on verbose mode. Can be iterated to increase the verbosity.
.TP
.B \-n
Do not modify files. Instead, the output of processing \fIfile\fR is
written to \fIfile\fR.esp. This option switches the \fB-v\fR on.
.TP
.B \-help, \--help
Show usage information.
