.TH HEVEA 1
.SH NAME
hevea \- A fast LaTeX to HTML translator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hevea
.I 
.RI "[options] <texfile>"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the
.BR hevea 
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
Using
.B hevea
it is possible to translate large documents written in LaTeX, such as
manuals, books, etc., very quickly into HTML. All documents are
translated as one single HTML file. The output file can be cut into
smaller files, using the companion program
.B hacha.
