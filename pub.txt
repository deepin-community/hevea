It is my pleasure to announce the new, 2.00 release of HEVEA.

    HEVEA is a LaTeX to HTML translator.  The input language is a
    fairly complete subset of LaTeX2e and the output
    language is HTML that is (hopefully) correct with respect to
    version 4.0 (transitional)

    HEVEA web page is <http://hevea.inria.fr/>

This release is a major one as hevea output has changed from
HTML 4.01 transitional to HTML version 5.
